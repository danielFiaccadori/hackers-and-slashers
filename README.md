#### Hey! welcome to my project :D
This is a mod that adds new simple mechanics for Minecraft combat, and an overhaul
in the critical system, bringing more strategy and dynamic gameplay!

## ‚ú® Features

</div>

### üó°Ô∏è Improved critical system

Critical system has been significantly improved. The vanilla critical has been
replaced by two critical types based on new mechanics added by the mod, all based on
RPG games.

<div style = "
            background-color: #1e1e1e;
            padding: 30px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            ">

#### **BACKSTAB**

To take advantage of the stealth system implemented in the mod, a critical hit based on
detection was added. Basically, if you are undetected and attack a mob, you will deal an
explosive amount of damage with a multiplier of `3x damage`, that increases slightly when using
weapons that has a higher attack speed.

<sub style="color: gray">_Against players, the backstab can be activated on attacks while out of its field of view._</sub>

</div>

<div style = "
            background-color: #1e1e1e;
            padding: 30px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            margin-top: 5%;
            margin-bottom: 5%;
            ">

#### **RIPOSTE**

The riposte is a critical type that is activated on targets stunned when successfully performing
a parry. This one, unlike the backstab, can easily be dealt multiple times in the same target, and has a
multiplier of `1.5x damage`.

</div>

For a better combat experience, **invulnerable ticks** also has been removed.


### üéÆ New gameplay and combat mechanics

New mechanics to match critical types and making them possible were added. Each one is a complement
for the current Minecraft's gaming logic. I tried to stay as close as possible to "What if Minecraft was a
Souls Like version of Minecraft Dungeons?" 

<div style = "
            background-color: #1e1e1e;
            padding: 30px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            margin-top: 5%;
            margin-bottom: 5%;
            ">

#### **ü•∑ Stealth**

Stealth is simple: sneak into dark places to remain absolutely undetected. This can be achieved without sneaking
while having an invisibility potion, but the effect is removed when attacked.

Stealthiness is represented by three visibility levels:

<div style = "
            background-color: #181818;
            padding: 10px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            margin-top: 5%;
            margin-bottom: 5%;
            ">

<img alt="Hackers &#39;n Slashers logo" src="src/main/resources/assets/hackersandslashers/textures/screens/alert.png" width="30" height="30"/>

`Alert` this state means that the player has been detected by a mob in the area.

</div>

<div style = "
            background-color: #181818;
            padding: 10px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            margin-top: 5%;
            margin-bottom: 5%;
            ">

<img alt="Hackers &#39;n Slashers logo" src="src/main/resources/assets/hackersandslashers/textures/screens/suspect.png" width="30" height="30"/>

`Suspect` this state means that the player has been seen, but not has been directly targeted. This state can
change either to alert or stealth during the next 3 seconds. 

</div>


<div style = "
            background-color: #181818;
            padding: 10px;
            border-radius: 2px;
            margin-top: 5%;
            margin-bottom: 5%;
            ">

<img alt="Hackers &#39;n Slashers logo" src="src/main/resources/assets/hackersandslashers/textures/screens/hidden.png" width="30" height="30"/>

`Hidden` this state means that the player has not been detected by any mod around.

For an even better combat experience, I highly recommend the mod <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-combat-by-daedelus">BetterCombat</a>, that
adds new incredible animations for weapons!
